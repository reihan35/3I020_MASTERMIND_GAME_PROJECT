## Installation

## Usage

Use lein if you want to launch the project.
There are two ways to launch it.

First way :
In a terminal, enter the repository of the game (~/projets_3I020/mastermind).
Then use this command : lein repl.
Afterwards, this line will appear on the terminal :

To launch the game, enter (-main) after the line above.
You should have this : mastermind.core=> (-main).
Finally enjoy the game !
